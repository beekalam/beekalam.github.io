<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-3">
<p>
Making assumptions in our relationships is really asking for
problems. Often we make the assumption that our partners know what we
think and that we don’t have to say what we want. We assume they are
going to do what we want, because they know us so well. If they don’t
do what we assume they should do, we feel so hurt and say, “You should
have known.”
</p>

<p>
It is very interesting how the human mind works. We have the need to
justify everything, to explain and understand everything, in order to
feel safe. We have millions of questions that need answers because
there are so many things that the reasoning mind cannot explain. It is
not important if the answer is correct; just the answer itself makes
us feel safe. This is why we make assumptions.
</p>

<p>
We make all sorts of assumptions because we don't have the courage
to ask the questions.
</p>

<p>
We make the assumption that everyone sees life the way we do. We
assume that others think the way we think, feel the way we feel, judge
the way we judge, and abuse the way we abuse. This is the biggest
assumption that humans make. And this is why we have a fear of being
ourselves around others. Because we think everyone else will judge us,
victimize us, abuse us, and blame us as we do ourselves. So even
before others have a chance to reject us, we have already rejected
ourselves. That is the way the human mind works.
</p>

<p>
The way to keep yourself from making assumptions is to ask
questions. Make sure the communication is clear. If you don’t
understand, ask. Have the courage to ask questions until you are clear
as you can be, and even then do not assume you know all there is to
know about a given situation. Once you hear the answer, you will not
have to make assumptions because you will know the truth.  Also, find
your voice to ask for what you want. Everybody has the right to tell
you no or yes, but you always have the right to ask. Likewise,
everybody has the right to ask you, and you have the right to say yes
or no.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-4">
<p>
THERE IS JUST ONE MORE AGREEMENT, BUT IT’S THE one that allows the
other three to become deeply ingrained habits. The fourth agreement is
about the action of the first three: Always do your best.
</p>

<p>
Under any circumstance, always do your best, no more and no less. But
keep in mind that your best is never going to be the same from one
moment to the next. Everything is alive and changing all the time, so
your best will sometimes be high quality, and other times it will not
be as good. When you wake up refreshed and energized in the morning,
your best will be better than when you are tired at night. Your best
will be different when you are healthy as opposed to sick, or sober as
opposed to drunk. Your best will depend on whether you are feeling
wonderful and happy, or upset, angry, or jealous.

Doing your best is taking the action because you love it, not because

"If you were to visit a dozen talent hotbeds tomorrow, you would be
struck by how much time the learners spend observing top
performers. When I say “observing,” I’m not talking about passively
watching. I’m talking about staring—the kind of raw, unblinking,
intensely absorbed gazes you see in hungry cats or newborn babies."
</p>


<p>
"We each live with a “windshield” of people in front of us; one of the
keys to igniting your motivation is to fill your windshield with vivid
images of your future self, and to stare at them every day. Studies
show that even a brief connection with a role model can vastly
increase unconscious motivation. For example, being told that you
share a birthday with a mathematician can improve the amount of effort
you’re willing to put into difficult math tasks by 62 percent."
</p>


<p>
"Think of your windshield as an energy source for your brain. Use
pictures (the walls of many talent hotbeds are cluttered with photos
and posters of their stars) or, better, video. One idea: Bookmark a
few YouTube videos, and watch them before you practice, or at night
before you go to bed."

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-2">
<p>
"What’s the best way to begin to learn a new skill? Is it by listening
to a teacher’s explanation? Reading an instructional book? Just
leaping in and trying it out? Many hotbeds use an approach I call the
engraving method."
</p>


<p>
"The key to effective engraving is to create an intense connection: to
watch and listen so closely that you can imagine the feeling of
performing the skill. For physical skills, project yourself inside the
performer’s body. Become aware of the movement, the rhythm; try to
feel the interior shape of the moves. For mental skills, simulate the
skill by re-creating the expert’s decision patterns. Chess players

"HARD, HIGH-PRECISION SKILLS are actions that are performed as

challenging, ever-changing environments. These are places where you
encounter different obstacles and respond to them over and over,
building the network of sensitive wiring you need to read, recognize,

<p>
"ELEMENT 1: REACHING AND REPEATING. Does the practice have you
operating on the edge of your ability, reaching and repeating?"
</p>


<p>
"ELEMENT 2: ENGAGEMENT. Is the practice immersive? Does it command
your attention? Does it use emotion to propel you toward a goal?"
</p>


<p>
"ELEMENT 3: PURPOSEFULNESS. Does the task directly connect to the
skill you want to build?"
</p>


<p>
"ELEMENT 4: STRONG, SPEEDY FEEDBACK. Does the learner receive a stream
of accurate information about his performance—where he succeeded and
where he made mistakes?"
</p>


<p>
"The idea of this gauge is simple: When given a choice between two
practice methods, or when you’re inventing a new test or game, pick
the one that maximizes these four qualities, the one with the most
R.E.P.S."

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-38">
<p>
"In many skills, particularly athletic, medical, and military ones,
there’s a long tradition of working until total exhaustion. This
tradition has its uses, particularly for improving fitness and mental
toughness, and for forging emotional connections within a group. But
when it comes to learning, the science is clear: Exhaustion is the
enemy. Fatigue slows brains. It triggers errors, lessens
concentration, and leads to shortcuts that create bad habits. It’s no
coincidence that most talent hotbeds put a premium on practicing when
people are fresh, usually in the morning, if possible. When exhaustion
creeps in, it’s time to quit."

"The previous tip was about the importance of practicing when you’re
fresh. This tip is about a different kind of freshness, which comes in
the moment just after a performance, game, or competition. At that
moment, practicing is probably the last thing you want to do. But it’s
the first thing you should do, if you’re not too worn out, because it
helps you target your weak points and fix them. As the golfer Jack
Nicklaus said, “I always achieve my most productive practice after an
actual round. Then, the mistakes are fresh in my mind and I can go to
the practice tee and work specifically on those mistakes.”"

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-43">
<p>
"Repetition is the single most powerful lever we have to improve our
skills, because it uses the built-in mechanism for making the wires of
our brains faster and more accurate"
</p>


<p>
"Moe Norman was a shy Canadian who played briefly on the professional
golf tour in the 1960s and ’70s. He was also, in most estimations, the
most accurate golfer in history. Norman shot seventeen holes in one,
three scores of 59, and, in Tiger Woods’s estimation, ranked as one of
two golfers in history who “owned their swing” (the other was Ben
Hogan). Norman was also a likely autistic who, at a young age, became
enraptured by the power of repetition. From the age of sixteen onward,
Norman hit eight hundred to a thousand balls a day, five days a week;
calluses grew so thick on his hands he had to pare them with a
knife. Because of his emotional struggles, Norman had difficulty
competing in tournaments. But at a demonstration in 1995, he hit
fifteen hundred drives in a row, all of them landing within fifteen
yards of each other. As Woods put it, Norman “woke up every day and
knew he was going to hit it well. Every day. It’s frightening how
straight he hits it.”"

<p>
"Embracing repetition means changing your mindset; instead of viewing
it as a chore, view it as your most powerful tool. As the martial
artist and actor Bruce Lee said, “I fear not the man who has practiced
ten thousand kicks once, but I fear the man who has practiced one kick
ten thousand times.”"

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-46">
<p>
"The solution is to ignore the bad habit and put your energy toward
building a new habit that will override the old one. A good example of
this technique is found in the work of the Shyness Clinic, a program
based in Los Altos, California, that helps chronically shy people
improve their social skills. The clinic’s therapists don’t delve into
a client’s personal history; "
</p>


<p>
"they don’t try to “fix” anything. Instead, they focus on building new
skills through what they call a social fitness model: a series of
simple, intense, gradually escalating workouts that develop new social
muscles. One of the first workouts for a Shyness Clinic client is to
walk up to a stranger and ask for the time. Each day the workout grows
more strenuous"
</p>


<p>
"To build new habits, start slowly. Expect to feel stupid and clumsy
and frustrated at first—after all, the new wires haven’t been built
yet, and your brain still wants to follow the old pattern. Build the
new habit by gradually increasing the difficulty, little by little. It
takes time, but it’s the only way new habits grow. For more insights
on this process, read The Power of Habit, by Charles Duhigg."

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-48">

"When it comes to growing new skills, eight weeks seems to be an
important threshold. It’s the length of many top-level training

program to the Meadowmount School of Music program to the clinics of
the Bolshoi Ballet to the mission training for the Mercury
astronauts. "

<p>
"Of course, this doesn’t mean that you can be proficient in any skill
in eight weeks. Rather, it underlines two more basic points: 1)
Constructing and honing neural circuitry takes time, no matter who you
are; and 2) Resilience and grit are vital tools, particularly in the
early phases of learning. Don’t make judgments too early. Keep at it,
even if you don’t feel immediate improvement. Give your talent (that
is, your brain) the time it needs to grow."

<p>
"We all know the feeling. You start out in a new skill, you progress
swiftly for a while, and then all of a sudden … you stop. Those are
called plateaus. "
</p>


<p>
"Research by Dr. K. Anders Ericsson, a professor of psychology at
Florida State University and coeditor of The Cambridge Handbook of
Expertise and Expert Performance, shows that the best way past a
plateau is to jostle yourself beyond it; to change your practice
method so you disrupt your autopilot and rebuild a faster, better
circuit. One way to do this is to speed things up—to force yourself to
do the task faster than you normally would."

<p>
"Or you can slow things down—going so slowly that you highlight
previously undetected mistakes. Or you can do the task in reverse
order, turn it inside out or upside down. It doesn’t matter which

autopilot and into your sweet spot."

<h3 id="org8d5e5af"><span class="section-number-3">2.50</span> "TIP #50 CULTIVATE YOUR GRIT"</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-50">
<p>
"Grit is that mix of passion, perseverance, and self-discipline that
keeps us moving forward in spite of obstacles. It’s not flashy, and
that’s precisely the point. In a world in which we’re frequently
distracted by sparkly displays of skill, grit makes the difference in
the long run."
</p>


<p>
"Recently, a University of Pennsylvania researcher named Angela
Duckworth measured the influence of grit on twelve hundred first-year
West Point cadets before they began a brutal summer training course
called the Beast Barracks. Before the course began, she gave the
cadets a brief test: seventeen questions that asked them to rate their
own ability to stick to goals, to be motivated by failure, and to
persist in the face of obstacles. It turned out that this test—which
took about two minutes to complete—was uncannily accurate at
predicting whether or not a cadet succeeded, far exceeding West
Point’s complex set of predictive criteria, including IQ,
psychological test results, grade-point average, and physical
fitness. The grit test has since been used to predict success in
schools, business, and a variety of other settings."
</p>


<p>
"Grit isn’t inborn. It’s developed, like a muscle, and that
development starts with awareness. To take Duckworth’s test, do a
computer search for “Grit Survey” (or go directly to
www.​authentichappiness​.​sas.​upenn.​edu/​tests/​SameAnswers/​t.​aspx?​id=​1246). Take
the test and use your score as a way to reflect on the role of this
quality in your life"
</p>


<p>
"For instance, when you hit an obstacle, how do you react? Do you tend
to focus on a long-term goal, or move from interest to interest? What
are you seeking in the long run? Begin to pay attention to places in
your life where you’ve got grit, and celebrate them in yourself and
others."
